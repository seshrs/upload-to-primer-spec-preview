# Upload to Primer Spec Preview

This GitHub Action uploads and deploys a site preview build to the Primer Spec Preview service. It also adds a comment to the Pull Request with a link to the site preview.

Contact seshrs@umich.edu if you have questions.

## Usage with Jekyll Site

Create a new workflow file in your repo at `.github/workflows/spec_preview.yml`. Add the following contents. Don't forget to update the lines marked as with `TODO:` comments.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow to generate and upload spec previews to
# Primer Spec Preview (https://github.com/seshrs/primer-spec-preview).
name: Generate spec preview

# Define conditions for when to run this action.
# We'll only generate spec previews on Pull Requests, and only when the
# `docs/` directory has been modified.

  pull_request:
    paths:
      # TODO: Change this to the directory containing your Jekyll site
